# HAProxy implementation of webconfig-spec

The initial pre-alpha implementation already exists [here](https://github.com/hanzz/micro-webapps/blob/master/docker-images/haproxy-frontend/haproxy-cfg), but needs documenting and polishing.

*This document is not final yet and can change without any notice. For now, it is mainly intended to be a working place where the ideas are put.*
